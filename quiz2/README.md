## Linked Lists

## Question 1
* Given head, the head of a linked list, determines if the linked list has a cycle in it.
* There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached againby continuously following the next pointer.
* Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to.
* Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
* Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## Question 2
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle.
 * Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

 ## Question 3
 * Write a function that takes a linked list and returns the reversed list.
